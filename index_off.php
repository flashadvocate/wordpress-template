<h1>Setting up your site and homepage</h1>

<p>To begin setting up your homepage, visit <a href="<?php echo site_url(); ?>/wp-admin">your site's admin panel</a>.</p>

<p>Visit '<a href="<?php echo site_url(); ?>/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_type=page">Pages->Add New</a>' to create a homepage.  On the right-hand side of the screen choose "Home Page" as the template.</p>

<p>Once you have created your "Home Page" you need to tell Wordpress to use that specific page as the site's homepage.  You can do so in '<a href="<?php echo site_url(); ?>/wp-admin/customize.php">Appearances->Customize</a>'.  Under 'Static Front Page' choose the page you just created.</p>
